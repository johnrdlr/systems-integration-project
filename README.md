<h3 align="center">NJIT Room Finder</h3>

  <p align="center">
    RoomFinder is a software as a service that provides the user with an up-to-date feed of all the usable NJIT classrooms. It will be using official data provided by NJIT and its associated sites that list where and when the course sections are being held. Currently, the only way to figure out if a classroom is available is by either physically going to the classroom or by searching a long course list that states when a section meets and its location. This project will provide a service to make it easier for students to find a room because of the lack of convenience that exists for them to check for unused classrooms.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is a showcase of system integration. By fully utilizing what has been taught throughout the Information Technology course load, this project combines all the skills and knowledge necessary to create a network of computers to work together to host a software as a service. The challenge imposed is getting all the subsystems and components to work together so that it can be one large system.
